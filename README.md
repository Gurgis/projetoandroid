# 🌦️ Challenge - Weather App

Welcome to the **Weather App Challenge!**
This repository contains the implementation of a simple weather application that retrieves and displays weather information using the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

We use predefined latitude and longitude coordinates from various cities to fetch and display detailed weather data, such as:

- 🌡️ Temperature
- 💧 Humidity
- 🌬️ Pressure

## 🚧 Current Status & To-Do List

The app is functional, but there are still some improvements and bug fixes to be made. Here's what's on our radar:

- [X] 🔑 Add your API key to the `local.properties` file:
`WEATHER_API_KEY= <your-api-key-here>`
- [X] 📊 Fetch and display **pressure** data from the API
- [X] 🔄 Implement data refresh on **Refresh** button click
- [X] 🎨 Fix broken **weather icons**
- [X] 🧹 Eliminate **duplicate data** issues

    🌍 Improve translation system for weather descriptions returned by the API — many terms are still not properly translated 

    🎨 Refine UI/UX design for a more polished and intuitive user experience 

    📅 Add multi-day forecast to provide richer weather information using more OpenWeather API endpoints 

    🌡️ Enrich detailed weather screen with more metrics (e.g., humidity, wind direction, visibility)
